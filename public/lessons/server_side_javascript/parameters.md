# Many Ways To Pass Parameters

in HTTP

* on the Path
  * (between the hostname and the `?`)
* in a GET request's "query" section
  * (after the `?`)
* in a POST request in query param format
  * (inside the request body)
* in a POST request in JSON format
  * (inside the request body)

e.g. when viewing a single file on github: 
```
{
  user: 'BurlingtonCodeAcademy',
  repo: 'til',
  section: 'blob',
  branch: 'master',
  filepath: '/README.md'
}
```

# Path Parameters

`http://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/til/blob/master/README.md`

path parameters are part of REST, which basically says "your URL is part of your UI; treat it like the address of a resource, not as a call to a function"


# Query Parameters

(aka search params / GET params)

`github.com/file?user=BurlingtonCodeAcademy&repo=til&section=blob&branch=master&filename=README.md`


# Post Parameters

POST params:
```
POST /file HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=BurlingtonCodeAcademy&repo=til&section=blob&branch=master&filename=README.md
```

# Post Body as JSON

this is the simplest way to understand, but it's not standard, so you may have to write more code to do it

```
POST /file HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: text/json

{"user":"BurlingtonCodeAcademy","repo":"til","section":"blob","branch":"master","filepath":"/README.md"}
```

# Summary: GET vs POST

remember, HTTP defines several *methods* (GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, etc...)

GET requests

 - Query Parameters are in the URL, after the `?`
 - format: `name=value&othername=othervalue`
 - plus weird escaping rules (percent-encoding and space-to-plus)

POST requests

 - Post Parameters are in the *body* of the request
 - Usually in the same `name=value&` format
 - Can also be big file uploads, or a JSON format payload, or others

# Parsing Parameters

Your app server framework (Express) might convert query or post params into an object for you, but it's not hard to do yourself.

Here's a small function that parses any string in "query parameter" (aka "URI Encoded") format, either from the `?` part of the URL, or the body of a request:

```javascript
@@@javascript
function decodeParams(query) {
  let fields = query.split('&');
  let params = {};
  for (let field of fields) {
    let [ name, value ] = field.split('=');
    value = value.replace(/\+/g,' ');
    params[name] = decodeURIComponent(value);
  }
  return params;
}
```

(Note that the above function assumes each parameter can only have one value; in HTTP it's possible for the client to pass several parameters with the same name, causing headaches for server API designers.)
