# What is an Operator?

A character or group of characters that represent an action to be taken on one or more values

# Types of Operators

* Unary Operators

  * `+`

  * `delete`

  * `typeof`

  * `void`

  * Incrementers/Decrementers

* Binary Operators

  * Arithmetic Operators

  * Logical Operators

  * Comparison Operators

  * Assignment Operators

  * Bitwise Operators

* Trinary Operators

  * The Ternary Operator

# The Unary `+`

The `+` operator can be used on an operand to convert that operand into a number.

```js
+"33" // => 33
+"0" // => 0
+"" // => 0
+" "// => 0
+"cheese" // => NaN
```

# Delete

The keyword `delete` is an operator that deletes whatever object, property, or element that's passed to it as an operand.

```js
delete objectName // deletes the object named `objectName`
delete objectName.prop // deletes the property `prop` off of the object `objectName`
delete arrayName[3] // deletes the element at index three of the array `arrayName`
```

# typeof

The keyword `typeof` is a unary operator that returns the type of the operand it's called on as a string.

```js
typeof function() {...} // => 'function'
typeof "Hello, world!" // => 'string'
typeof [1, 2, 3, "red"] // => 'object'
typeof unassignedVariable // => 'undefined'
typeof false // => 'boolean'
typeof null // => 'object'
```

# Void

The `void` keyword takes an expression as its operand and causes it to return `undefined` rather than the normal return value of the expression.

```js
void (1+1) // => undefined

function sayHello() { return "Hello, world!" }

void sayHello() // => undefined
```

# Incrementers/Decrementers

Incrementers and decrementers are not officially classified in JavaScript as unary operators since they behave slightly diferently than other operators, they are instead given their own special classification. However since they only accept one operand they are, by definition, unary operators.

* `++` increments the value to its left by one

* `--` decrements the value to its left by one

```js
3++ // => 4
7-- // => 6
"cheese"++ // => NaN
```
> Note: the incrementer and decrementer only work on the number type.

# Arithmetic Operators

Takes two numbers and performs an operation on them

Returns a **new** number

* `+` addition

* `-` subtraction

* `*` multiplication

* `/` division

* `%` modulus

* `**` exponent

```javascript
2 + 1 // => 3
2 - 1 // => 1
2 * 2 // => 4
6 / 2 // => 3
6 % 3 // => 0
5 ** 2 // => 25
```

# Lab: Arithmetic

In the terminal go into a node environment, and try to figure out the answers to the following questions using arithmetic operators

  * Does JavaScript follow order of operations when parsing equations?

  * What happens when you try to add a string number (e.g. `"12"`) to an actual number?

  * What happens when you try and subtract a string number from an actual number?

  * What happens when you perform arithmetic operations on strings?

    * addition?

    * subtraction?

    * multiplication?

    * division?

  * Can you perform operations on `NaN`?

  * Assign a variable `x` to a numerical value

    * perform an operation on `x`, what is the return value? What is the value of x?

# Logical Operators

Evaluates two values or expressions and returns a boolean

* `&&` **and**; evaluates true if BOTH sides are truthy

* `||` **or**; evaluates true if EITHER side is truthy

* `!` **not**; inverts the truthyness/falsyness of the preceding value or expression

```javascript
'dog' && 'cat' // => 'cat'
null && 'cat' // => false
'dog' || 'cat' // => 'dog'
undefined || 'cat' // => 'cat'
!true // => false
!(7 < 5) // => true
```

# Comparison Operators

Compares two values and returns a boolean

* `>` greater than

* `<` less than

* `>=` greater than or equal to

* `<=` less than or equal to

* `==` equal to

* `===` identity

* `!=` not equal

* `!==` REALLY not equal

```javascript
5 > 3 // => true
5 < 3 // => false
5 >= 3 // => true
5 <= 5 // => true
5 == '5' // => true
5 === '5' // => false
'cat' != 'dog' // => true
'cat' !== 'cat' // => false
```

# Equals vs Identity

It is worth noting the descrepency between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`.The double equals will try and coerce the operands so that they match if possible, while the triple equals will perform a comparison on the values as they are.  When comparing two values you should **always** use the triple equals.

# Lab: Compare and Contrast

Open up a node environment in your terminal, and let's play around with some comparison operators.

* What happens when you compare two strings with greater than `>`?

  * Did it give you the value you expected?

  * What do you think it's using to compare the two?

* What's the difference between the double equals `==` and triple equals `===`?

* Are two empty arrays equal to each other? How about two arrays with identical content?

# Assignment Operators

Modifies an existing value
MUTATES the value

* `=` sets the variable on the left equal to the value on the right

* `+=` adds the value to the right to the variable on the left

* `-=` subtracts the value to the right from the variable on the left

```javascript
let x = 7
let y = 3

1 += 2 // => 3
x = y // x => 3
x += y // x => 10
x -= y // x => 4
```

# Lab: Assignments
Let's take a few minutes to play around with assignment operators, so go ahead open up a node environment in your terminal, and let's figure some things out.

* assign a variable `x` using the `let` keyword to a numerical value.

* assign a variable `y` using the `const` keyword to a numerical value.

* add a value to x using the `+=` operator. What's the value of `x`?

* add a value to y using the `+=` operator. Did you get the value you expected?

* create a variable named `string` that is a string.

  * add a value to `string` using `+=`, what is the value of `string`?

  * What is the value of `string` if you use `-=` instead?

# Bitwise Operators

Bitwise Operators treat their operands as a set of 32 bits(binary), rather than as decimal, or hexadecimal operators, but they return standard JavaScript numbers. These operators are very fast and powerful, but can be rather confusing as they are directly manipulating binary values.

* `&` "and", returns a 1 in the bit position where the bits in both operands are 1

* `|` "or", returns a 0 in the bit position where the bits in both operands are 0

* `^` "xor", returns a 0 in the bit position where the bits in both operands are the same

* `~` "not", inverts the bits of its operand

```js
15 & 9 // => 9; binary 1111 & 1001 evaluates to 1001 (9)
15 | 9 // => 15; binary 1111 | 1001 evaluates to 1111 (15)
15 ^ 9 // => 6; binary 1111 ^ 1001 evaluates to 0110 (6)
~15 // => -16; binary ~0000...001111 evaluates to 1111..110000 (-16)
```

# The Ternary Operator

The ternary operator, also called the conditional operator, is the only trinary operator in JavaScript, and is a way of handeling control flow.

```js
expression ? valueOne : valueTwo // If the expresion evaluates to true returns valueOne, otherwise returns valueTwo
```
