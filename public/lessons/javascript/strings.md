# String Literals

* The word **literal** means "exactly as written" 
* A **string literal** is a string, whose characters are written out explicitly in your code
* JavaScript string literals are **surrounded** with either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`)
  * *but not both in the same string!*

```js
'My dog has fleas'
"Vermonters have a hundred words for 'snow'"
```

---

# String Escaping

* Some characters cannot be typed literally, so you need to use an **escape character** to represent it
* Backslash (<kbd>\\</kbd>) is the *escape character* in JavaScript strings
* Backslash means "the next character means something special"
  * For instance backslash-n (`\n`) means "newline"

```js
console.log('Roses are red,\nViolets are blue;\nCandy is sweet,\nAnd so are you.')
```

# String Messages

A string understands lots of **messages**.

Here are a few:

```js
'drive' + 'way'
'Java' + "Script"
"Bert's pal Ernie" + ' sings "Rubber Duckie"'

'banana'.length

'titanic'.toUpperCase()
'QUIETLY'.toLowerCase()

'Hello'.concat(', world!')
'All dogs are good dogs'.replaceAll('dogs', 'puppers')

'Java'.repeat(10)

'berry'.charAt(0)
'berry'.charAt(1)

'banana'.includes('nan')
'banana'.endsWith('ana')

'blueberry'.replace('blue', 'black')
```

Try all of these out in an interactive `node` shell or a JavaScript file in your editor.

# Lab: Combining Concepts

Let's try chaining a few of these methods together.

Given the following String

```js
'this is a fantastic string'
```

Can you send messages to it to print the following?

```
THIS
IS
A
FANTASTIC
STRING
```

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

<div>
You can chain multiple methods off of each other by calling them one after another. e.g.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">"Hello".repeat(3).toUpperCase()<code></pre>

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

<div>

There is a message that can substitute all the `subString` values in a string with the `newValue`.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">.replaceAll(subString, newValue)<code></pre>

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

<div>

The newline character can be used to create line breaks.
<pre><code class="language-javascript">'\n'<code></pre>

</div>
</details>

# Slicing and Dicing

Every string is made of lots of other strings.

You can pull out parts of a string with the `slice` message.

```js
// this means "slice from character 0 to character 4"
'blueberry'.slice(0, 4) 

// this means "slice from character 4 to the end
'blueberry'.slice(4)
```

> These start and end numbers are called *indexes*, or *indices* if you're feeling fancy.

# String Indexing Explained

Humans like to start counting at 1, but computers like to start counting at 0.

This can be confusing, so here's a visualization to help explain it.

Think of the indexes as pointing at the *spaces between* characters, as in this diagram:

    | B | L | U | E | B | E | R | R | Y |
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
     
So with this picture in your mind, `slice`...
  
   * includes the character to the *right* of the start index
   * includes the character to the *left* of the end index...
   * ...but *excludes* the character to the *right* of the end index

Try various start and end values in the console and see what happens!

# Characters

Q: A string is "a series of characters"... but what is a character?

A: A character is a *number* (or *character code*) that stands for a *symbol*.

|symbol|code|name|
|---|---|---|
| `A` | 65 | capital A |
| `B` | 66 | capital B |
| `Z` | 90 | capital Z |
| `_` | 95 | underscore |
| `a` | 97 | lowercase A |
| ??? | 10 | newline |

(Some characters stand for *unprintable* symbols like `newline` or `tab` or `bell`.)

# ASCII and Ye Shall Receive

* ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange
* Was invented in 1963, in the United States...

# Unicode

* ASCII only goes from 0 to 127
* Unicode is the same as ASCII for values from 0 and 127
    * but Unicode goes a *lot* higher
* Currently more than 130,000 characters, including symbols for
  * 139 modern and historic scripts
  * accents and other diacritics
  * various mathematical âˆž, currency Â£, and cultural â˜® symbols

# Unicode Strings

JavaScript strings are Unicode

> That means you can use emoji in your JavaScript programs!

Like the following:

```js
'ðŸ˜‚'.repeat(20)
> 'ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚'

'ðŸ˜‚'.codePointAt(0)
> 128514

String.fromCodePoint(128514)
> 'ðŸ˜‚'
```

 * Sadly, this *may* not work by default in Windows Cmd or PowerShell

# Comparing Strings

JavaScript strings respond to the `<` and `>` operators.

```js
> 'apple' > 'cherry'
false
> 'banana' < 'cherry'
true
```

> Strings are compared *one character at a time* using the *Unicode values* of each character.

---

# Comparing Strings: Example

So if you say `'apple' < 'apricot'`, JavaScript does something like this behind the scenes:

```js
> 'apple'.charCodeAt(0)
97
> 'apricot'.charCodeAt(0)
97

> 'apple'.charCodeAt(1)
112
> 'apricot'.charCodeAt(1)
112

> 'apple'.charCodeAt(2)
112
> 'apricot'.charCodeAt(2)
114
```

In the above, 112 is less than 114, so the comparison stops there and returns `true`.

---

# String Comparison Gotcha

In ASCII and Unicode, all the uppercase letters are together (codes 65 to 90), then all lowercase letters (codes 97 to 122).

> That means that **all** uppercase strings are less than **all** lowercase strings.

```js
> 'apple' < 'banana'
true
> 'apple' < 'BANANA'
false
```

The standard left-to-right code-to-code comparison algorithm is simplistic but very fast.

It works fine for many applications, but if you're dealing with user input or multiple languages...
