# What makes an Object?

We have set up some objects previously, but what actually makes an object? Is it the presence of properties? Methods? Both? Neither? Do any other JavaScript data types behave like objects?

# Arrays are Objects

Surprise! 

Every JavaScript *array* is also a JavaScript *object*

That means that arrays have *properties* and *methods* like any other object.

Examples:

  * `array.length` is a *read-only property* that always contains the number of elements in the array
  * `array.reverse()` is a *method* that reverses the ordering of all elements in the array 

See [MDN: Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2) to see a lot more array methods

# Iteration Methods

Every JavaScript array has a few [very handy methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods)
that let you *apply a function* to its contents.

| method | description | returns |
|---|---|---|
| [`forEach`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)  | do something to each item | `undefined`|
| [`find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)  | find the first item that matches | one matching item (or `undefined` if no match) |
| [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) | accept or reject each item | a new collection, possibly smaller |
| [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)  | change each item into a new item | a new collection of the same size |
| [`reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)  | scan the entire collection and "reduce" it to... | ...a single result, e.g. a total |

* We call this group of methods "[iteration methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods)"
* There are about a dozen built-in iteration methods, plus lots more added by libraries like [lodash](https://lodash.com/). 

# forEach

`forEach` works a lot like `for..of`, but using a callback function

Given this array of names...

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Charlie', 'David']
```
this code...

```js
for (let name of names) {
  console.log(name.toUpperCase())
}
```

and this code ...

```js
function printUpper(name) {
  console.log(name.toUpperCase())
}

names.forEach(name => printUpper)
```

both print the same thing:

```text
ALICE
BOB
CAROL
CHARLIE
DAVID
```

# Find

to find the first item that matches the condition...

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Charlie', 'David'];
let beginsWithC = function(word) {
    return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() === 'C';
};
let cName = names.find(beginsWithC) //=> 'Carol'
```

Note that:

* the `beginsWithC` function returns `true` or `false`
* the `find` method returns an item (from the array)

# Find Inline

For conciseness, people often define the filter function *inline*, like this:

```javascript
names.find((word) => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() === 'C')
```

Q: Is this more or less clear than the previous slide?

# Lab: Find a Berry

Given the following array:

```javascript
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Blueberry', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']
```

write some code that uses `find` to return the first item that ends with the string `'berry'`

(in this case, `'Blueberry'`)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<div>

```js
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Blueberry', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];

function endBerry(word) {
  return word.endsWith("berry")
}

fruits.find(endBerry)
```

</div>
</details>

# Filter

the `filter` iteration method returns *all* matching values, in a *new array*

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Carol', 'David'];
let beginsWithC = function(word) {
    return word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() === 'C';
}
let cNames = names.filter(beginsWithC) //=> [ 'Charlie', 'Carol' ]
```

# Lab: Find all Berries

Given the following array:

```javascript
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Blueberry', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']
```

Now go find your code from the previous lab ("Find a Berry")
and change it to use `filter` to return a new array 
containing **all** the fruits that end with the string `'berry'`

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<div>

```js
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Blueberry', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];

function endBerry(word) {
  return word.endsWith("berry")
}

fruits.filter(endBerry)
```

</div>
</details>

# Map

The `map` iteration method returns a *new array* whose elements correspond to the elements of the original array.

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Carol', 'David'];
let upper = function(word) {
    return word.toUpperCase();
}
let bigNames = names.map(upper) //=> [ 'ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE', 'CAROL', 'DAVID' ]
```

It's called "map" because in a mathematical sense, it defines a *mapping* from one collection to another.

| from | to |
|---|---|
| 'Alice'| 'ALICE' | 
| 'Bob'| 'BOB' |
| 'Charlie' | 'CHARLIE' |
| 'Carol' | 'CAROL' |
| 'David' | 'DAVID' |

# Lab: Titleize with Map

Remember the [capitalize function](/lessons/javascript-track/functions#anchor/capitalize)? It capitalizes the first letter of a string and makes the whole rest of the string lowercase.

```javascript
function capitalize(word) {
  let firstLetter = word[0];
  let restOfWord = word.slice(1);
  return firstLetter.toUpperCase() + restOfWord.toLowerCase();
}
```

Now please try to write a function that capitalizes *each word* in a string.

```javascript
titleize("the rain in spain falls MAINLY on the PLAIN")
  //=> 'The Rain In Spain Falls Mainly On The Plain'
```

There is a solution on the next slide, but please try on your own first.

# Solution: Titleize

<details>
<summary>Hint<summary>

<div>
Inside your titleize function, you could call the existing capitalize function. Or you could "inline" the capitalization code. 
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<div>

```javascript
function capitalize(word) {
  let firstLetter = word[0];
  let restOfWord = word.slice(1);
  return firstLetter.toUpperCase() + restOfWord.toLowerCase();
}

function titleize(phrase) {
    let words = [];
    phrase.split(' ').forEach((word) => {
        words.push(capitalize(word))
    });
    return words.join(' ');
}
```

</div>
</details>

# Aside: Method Chaining

* The solution above uses **method chaining** -- taking the **result** of one method, and immediately calling a method on that result **without assigning it to a variable**, again and again until you get a final result.
* Method chaining can be very elegant, but it can also be very dense, making the code harder to understand, test, and debug.
* "Unspooling" a method chain into intermediate variables (like example 3) can make the code easier to follow, but it can also make it cluttered and obscure the algorithm.

# Reduce

The `reduce` method keeps track of a *running total* (aka *accumulator* or *memo*); whatever value the function returns is used as the accumulator for the next pass.

Here's some code that counts the total number of letters across all words in an array:

```javascript
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Carol', 'David'];
const reducer = function(accumulator, word) {
    return accumulator + word.length;
};
let totalCount = names.reduce(reducer, 0); //=> 25
```

The `reduce` algorithm can be difficult to follow at first; here's a walkthrough:

| Iteration | Accumulator In | Word | Length | Accumulator Out |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  0 | 'Alice'   | 5 | 0 + 5 = 5 |
| 2 |  5 | 'Bob'     | 3 | 5 + 3 = 8 |
| 3 |  8 | 'Charlie' | 7 | 8 + 7 = 15 |
| 4 | 15 | 'Carol'   | 5 | 15 + 5 = 20 |
| 5 | 20 | 'David'   | 5 | 20 + 5 = 25 |

See how the accumulator is used to pass information from one iteration to the next?
