# Loops

Computers are like robots. They are good at doing things over and over and over and over again.

A LOOP is when we ask a program to do something many times.

# while

The simplest loop in JavaScript is `while`.

```js
while (someCondition) {
    someAction()
}
```

In English this reads, "While some condition is true, do some action".

# while true

If you want something to keep going forever, set condition to `true`:

```js
while (true) {
  console.log("Hello")
}
```

This means "While true is true, say 'Hello'". Obviously `true` will always be true, so it goes forever.

To stop it, hold down the CONTROL key and press the C key.

This is called an *infinite loop*.

**Note well!** The lines between `{` and `}` are INDENTED. Indentation is very important to you and other humans. It lets our eyes follow the patterns and helps us quickly see what parts of the program go with each other.

# Infinite Counting

Let's write a program that counts from 0 to infinity. Put this in a file called `count.js`.

```js
let count = 0;
while (true) {
    console.log(count);
    count = count + 1;
}
```

Run the program with `node count.js`.

> Remember, CONTROL-C means "Stop everything!!!"

# LAB: Who wants to loop forever?

Next, we will change your `count.js` program so that it only counts to 100.

Please try this yourself! But it's kind of tricky, so on the next slide I'll show you one solution.

# Solution: Who wants to loop forever?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Remember, a while loop only runs while the check evaluates true

<div>

```js
while(/*this expression is true...*/) {
    // ...do this action
}
```

</div>
</details>


<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

<div>

```js
let count = 1;
while (count <= 100) {
    console.log(count);
    count = count + 1;
}
```

</div>
</details>

Did your program stop at 100, 101, or 99?

# `while`

* The `while` statement keeps checking the expression

  * if it's `true` then it loops back
  * if it's `false` then it stops looping and goes on to the rest of the program

This is fairly complicated, so let's stop here and make sure to understand everything that's happening in this little program.

# `while` breakdown (pt.1)

    let count = 1

creates a *variable* named `count` and sets its value to `1`.

    while (count <= 100)

starts a loop and immediately compares `count` to `100`.

`1` is less than `100`, so the expression is `true`, so we continue with the block of code starting with the `{`.

# `while` breakdown (pt.2)

      console.log(count);

prints the current value of count.

      count = count + 1

*increments* the `count` variable... it was `1`, so now it's `2`

    }

goes *back to the `while` line* and checks again

# `while` breakdown (pt.3)

    while (count <= 100)

compares `count` to `100`.

`2` is less than `100`, so the expression is `true`, so we continue with the loop.

Eventually, `count` becomes `101`, and the `while` expression is `false`, and so we stop looping and go on.

# break dancing

The magic word `break` stops a loop immediately.

Here's a more verbose way of counting to 100:

```js
let count = 0;
while (true) {
    console.log(count);
    count = count + 1;
    if (count > 100) {
        break;
    }
}
```

# LAB: One Potato

Remember this poem?

    1 potato,
    2 potato,
    3 potato,
    4!
    5 potato,
    6 potato,
    7 potato,
    More!

Please write a program called `potato.js` that prints that poem, using loops.

(No, you can't just print the entire poem as a single string; that would be cheating.)

# Many Potatoes, Many Solutions

Remember, there's always more than one solution to any problem! Don't get fixated on finding the One Right Answer.

> "The strategy is definitely: first make it work, then make it right, and, finally, make it fast."
> - Brian Kernighan, creator of the C programming language

In the next slides we will examine several different ways to write the One Potato program.

> Note: changing the design of a program that's already working correctly is called **refactoring**

# functional decomposition

The first thing we'll do is *decompose* the problem into two smaller problems:

1. counting from 1 to 8
2. printing the correct message for each line

*Decomposition* is one of the most important skills in programming. It lets you focus.

Also known as "*divide and conquer*".

Introducing a *function* is the most straightforward way to embody a smaller task.

[Modular Decomposition](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~evs/songs/Modular_20Decomposition.mp3) song by Eric Siegel, Ph.D.

# Fake it till you make it

Functional decomposition is also a great way to write a program that you haven't quite figured out yet.

When you reach a step that you don't know how to do, or just don't want to think about right now, call a function *that you haven't written yet*.

Then later on -- only *after* the parent function is written -- go back and make the faked-out function work.

# counting potatoes

Let's separate *formatting* from *counting*.

This function does one thing only: create the correct string for a given line number.

```js
function poemLine(lineNumber) {
    if (lineNumber === 8) {
        return "More!"
    } else if (lineNumber === 4) {
        return "4!"
    } else {
        return lineNumber + " potato,"
    }
}
```

Now that we have an isolated formatting function, let's look at different ways to do looping.

# `while true`

```js
let i = 1;
while (true) {
    console.log(poemLine(i));
    i = i + 1;
    if (i > 8) {
        break;
    }
}
```

# `while`

```js
let i = 1;
while (i <= 8) {
    console.log(poemLine(i));
    i = i + 1;
}
```

# `for`

JavaScript inherited `for(;;)` from C; it's cumbersome and confusing but you should learn to recognize it.

```js
for (var i=0; i < 8; i++) {
  console.log(poemLine(i));
}
```

|phrase|meaning|
|---|---|
| `for`                    | in a loop, |
| `var i`                  | make an *index* variable named `i` |
| `i=0`                    | and initially set it to `0` |
| `i < 8`                  | then, as long as `i` is less than `8` |
| `{` ... `}`              | execute this block of code |
| `console.log(poemLine(i))` | (which prints the `i+1`th potato message) |
| `i++`                    | and then *increment* `i` before the next time through |

> Note that `i++` is executed **after** the `console.log` (the "body") and **before** the second `i<8` (the "condition").

# `for..of`

The `for..of` loop was added to JavaScript fairly recently. It loops over an [array](/lessons/javascript-track/arrays) and hides the messy details of initializing and incrementing a counter:

```javascript
const lineNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
for (let lineNumber of lineNumbers) {
  console.log(poemLine(lineNumber));
}
```

# LAB: Prime Numbers

A *prime number* is one that is only *divisible* by itself and 1.

The goal of this lab is to print all (and only) the prime numbers between 2 and 100.

To do this, your code will probably need to use one or the other, or both, of these:

  * *nested functions* - functions that call other functions
  * *nested loops* - loops that contain other loops

# Prime Numbers solution

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
<div>
You may want to use the logic in the `isDivisible` function you made during the functional labs.

```js
function divisible(divisor, dividend) {
    if (!(divisor % dividend)) {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}
```

Fake it till you make it!

```js
function isPrime(number) {
    return true
}
```

Use a while loop to iterate through all the integers between your number and 2

```js
let count = 2

while (count < number) {
    //Your code goes here
}
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<div>

```js
function isPrime(number) {
    let count = 2
    
    while (count < number) {
        if (!(number % count)) {
            return false
        } else {
            count++
        }
    }

    return true
}

let currentNumber = 100

while (currentNumber > 2) {
    if(isPrime(currentNumber)) {
        console.log(currentNumber)
        currentNumber--
    } else {
        currentNumber--
    }
}

```
