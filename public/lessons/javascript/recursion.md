# Recursion

*recursion* is when a function *calls itself*

(like Ouroboros, a mythical serpent who eats its own tail)

# Infinite Recursion

Here's a not very useful recursive function:

```js
function go() {
  console.log("Go!");
  go();                // do it all again
}
```

Call this function with `go()`, then either wait a few seconds, or stop it by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.

`RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` means that `go` has called itself too many times.

# Recursion Requires Termination

For recursion to be useful, it needs to (eventually) stop.

The standard way to stop is called a *guard clause*.

Also called a *base case* or a *terminator*.

```js
function countdown(seconds) {
  if (seconds === 0) {
    console.log("Blastoff!");
  }
```

This means, "When seconds reaches 0, **stop recursing**."

# Countdown

The simplest form of recursion uses a counter; in this example we are counting down the seconds until a rocket launches.

```js
function countdown(seconds) {
  if (seconds == 0) {
    console.log("Blastoff!");
  } else {
    console.log("" + seconds + "...");
    let nextCount = seconds - 1;
    countdown(nextCount);
  }
}

countdown(10);
```

Put the above in a source file called `countdown.js` and try it now. 

Note that you *must change* the value; otherwise you will recurse forever.

# Exercise: Draw It Out

Please dive into the above `countdown` function in excruiciating detail.

Fill out the cells of the following table for the call `countdown(5)`:

| Iteration | seconds | nextCount |
|---|---|---|
| 0 |   |   |
| 1 |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |

# Recursion is Reduction

In addition to the base case, a recursive function needs to define at least one other case; this case *wraps around* the base case like a Russian doll.

![matryoshka](/images/matryoshka.jpg)

You can think of a recursive function as starting with a large problem, and gradually reducing the problem until it reaches the base case.

Since the base case has a known solution, every other step can then be built back up on top of it -- which is why it's called the *base*.

In this way, recursion is an example of the *divide and conquer* approach to problem-solving.

# Lab: Recursive Factorial

To find the *factorial* of a number N, take all the counting numbers between 1 and N and multiply them together.

Write a recursive function called `factorial` that takes a number and returns its factorial.

Remember to start with the base case!

```js
factorial(1)    // 1
factorial(2)    // 2
factorial(3)    // 6
factorial(10)   // 3628800
```

# Solution: Factorial

You may want to use logic to define the base case, and breakpoints. e.g.

```js
if (number === 1) {
  return 1
}
```

```js
function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 1) {
        return 1;

        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

# Exercise: Draw It Out

Please dive into the above `factorial` function in excruciating detail.

Fill out the cells of the following table for the call `factorial(5)`:

| Iteration | n | (n - 1) | factorial(n - 1) | return value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 |   |   |   |   |
| 1 |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |
| 4 |   |   |   |   |

# Recursion vs Loops

Recursion can be seen as another kind of [loop](loops), like `for` or `while` or `reduce`.

In fact, most recursive functions can be "unrolled" and rewritten using a loop and a [stack](stacks).

For example, here is `factorial` using a stack instead of recursion:

```js
function factorial(n) {
    let stack = [];
    while (n >= 1) {
        stack.push(n);
        n = n - 1;
    }
    let f = 1;
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        f = f * stack.pop();
    }
    return f;
}

console.log(factorial(5)) // => 120
```

What do you think about this implementation compared to the previous one? What are the advantages and disadvantages of recursion vs. loops?

# Lab: Recursive Fibonacci

Using recursion, write a program called `fib.js` so that running `node fib.js 10` prints

```js
[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ]
```

which are the first 10 elements of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

Look back to fibonacci using stacks. Instead of looping with `while` you can use recursion
