# Input and Output

* Computers have many senses -- keyboard, mouse, network card, camera, joystick, etc. Collectively, these are called **INPUT**.

* Computers can also express themselves in many ways -- text, graphics, sound, networking, printing, etc. Collectively, these are called **OUTPUT**.

* Input and Output together are called **I/O**.

* the only part of your laptop that is *really* a computer is the CPU and the RAM; all the other parts (keyboard, trackpad, display, disk drive, etc.) are technically I/O devices 

# Memory vs I/O

* Performing *calculations* and accessing *memory* is **very fast**
* ...but reading and writing to I/O devices is **slow**
    * (at least as far as the CPU is concerned)
    * I/O operations can take *seconds* or *milliseconds*; CPU operations take *nanoseconds*
* Every time you ask JavaScript to do an I/O operation, it *pauses your program*
  * this allows the CPU to spend time doing other things, not just sitting idle waiting for a key to be pressed or a file to be written
* In NodeJS, you have to write a function for JavaScript to run once it *resumes*
    * this function is named an *asynchronous callback*
    * *asynchronous* is Greek for "out of time" or "not together in time"

# Terminal I/O

* In JavaScript,
    * `console.log` means "print a line to the terminal"

* In NodeJS,
    * `process.stdin` means "input coming from the terminal"

    * Reading a line in NodeJS is **weird**; here's one way to do it

```js
process.stdin.once('data', (chunk) => { console.log(chunk.toString()) } )
```

> The weirdness is explained on the next slide!

# node load code, decoded

```js
process.stdin.once('data',
    (chunk) => { console.log(chunk.toString()) }
)
```

> `once` is a function that takes two parameters,
> and its second parameter is **another function**

|phrase|meaning|
|---|---|
| `process.stdin`        | hey terminal input, |
| `.once('data',` ... `)`  | when you get some data, |
| `(chunk)`              | please name it `chunk` |
| ` => `                 | and send it to |
| ` { ` ... ` }`         | this block of code |
| `console.log(chunk.toString())`   | convert it to a string and print it to the terminal |

# Welcome to Callback City!

The previous one-liner code is equivalent to this:

```js
function printLine(chunk) { 
    console.log(chunk) 
}
process.stdin.once('data', printLine);
```

The `printLine` function itself is called a *callback* 
(since you are asking the I/O device to *call you back* when it receives input).

# LAB: Hello, friend!

1. Open `hello.js` in your text editor
2. Change it to contain the following code:

```js
console.log("What is your name?");
process.stdin.once('data', (chunk) => {
    let name = chunk.toString();
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
});
```

3. Save the file and switch back to the terminal
4. Run the program using `node hello.js`
5. Type in your name and press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key (also called <kbd>Enter</kbd>)

What happens? Is this what you expected?

# Yikes!

* Uh-oh! We've got trouble... what is that exclamation point doing way down there?

* The first thing to do is DON'T PANIC!
* You are *totally* going to figure this out.
* And even if you don't, you haven't actually broken anything.
* In fact, it's really hard to break a computer just by typing, so stay calm.

# Control-C to close

* First things first: get back to the command line
* This program doesn't *exit* yet, so you will need to *force* it to close
* Do this by holding down CONTROL and pressing C
    * abbreviated ⌃C or CTRL-C

# Let's fix this

* Have you figured out what the problem is?
* If not, I'll tell you on the next slide.
* Take a second and try to figure it out first. I'll wait.

# The newline character

* Here's a fun fact:
* In addition to letters, numbers, and punctuation, computers also store other keys inside strings
* Among these CONTROL CHARACTERS is the one that represents the RETURN KEY
* This character's name is NEWLINE
* Every time you read a line, the computer reads *all* the characters, *including the newline*!

# Trim it

* Fortunately, there's an easy fix
* If you send the message `trim` to a string, it will remove all SPACES and NEWLINES from both ends

# Solution: fixing Hello, Friend

* If you're still struggling to sanatize your input change the program to look like this:

```js
console.log("What is your name?");
process.stdin.once('data', (chunk) => {
    let name = chunk.toString().trim();
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
});
```

* Run it and make sure it works OK
* Press ⌃C to close it

# This Way To The Exit

* Change the program to look like this:

```js
console.log("What is your name?");
process.stdin.once('data', (chunk) => {
    let name = chunk.toString().trim();
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    process.exit();
});
```

Note that:

  * `process.exit` uses the same `process` object as `process.stdin`
  * The call to `process.exit()` must be *inside* the callback
    * Otherwise, what happens? Try it and see!

# LAB: Capitalization

* What happens if you type your name in all lowercase?
* Make the program capitalize your name for you even if you forget.

**Hint**: remember `slice` from the [Strings lesson](/lessons/javascript-track/strings)?

# YELL YOUR NAME!

* Now go crazy and make it YELL your name!
    * Hint: Use the [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) method

Okay, that was a bit much. Let's go back to just having our name capitalized.

# readline

* NodeJS is more than a *JavaScript interpreter*
* It's also a collection of *JavaScript libraries*
* One of the libraries is called `readline`
    * `readline` makes it easier to read lines, naturally :-)
    * the "books" in this library are functions
      * (and classes and other things too)

# using readline

> Warning: this code uses features we have not yet covered! Copy and paste it verbatim during the codealong below, and don't worry if it doesn't make much sense yet.

To use `readline`, include the following lines in the top of your source file:

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');
const readlineInterface = readline.createInterface(process.stdin, process.stdout);

function ask(questionText) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    readlineInterface.question(questionText, resolve);
  });
}
```

# using readline - explanation

|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `const readline = require('readline');`                     | load the `readline` package and name it `readline`                                                                                      |
| `const readlineInterface = readline.createInterface({...})` | create an *interface* to readline using the following settings:                                                                         |
| `  process.stdin,`                                | for input, use the *standard input stream* (i.e. terminal keyboard input)                                                               |
| `  process.stdout`                               | for output, use the *standard output stream* (i.e. terminal console output)                                                             |
| `function ask(questionText) {...}`                          | a function named *ask* that uses the [Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) to asynchronously ask a question and wait for a reply |

(We will cover the Promise API in much more detail later; for now, all you really need to know is that Promises allow us to use `async` and `await` in the next slide.)

# LAB: using readline and await

Codealong time! Please follow along with the instructor and enter this code into a file named `quest.js`:

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');
const readlineInterface = readline.createInterface(process.stdin, process.stdout);

function ask(questionText) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    readlineInterface.question(questionText, resolve);
  });
}

start();

async function start() {
  let name = await ask('What is your name? ');
  let quest = await ask('What is your quest? ');
  let color = await ask('What is your favorite color? ');
  console.log('Hello ' + name + '! ' +
    'Good luck with ' + quest + ', ' +
    'and here is a ' + color + ' flower for you.');
  process.exit();
}
```

* run it from the command line using `node quest.js`

# async and await

* We will learn a lot more about callbacks, promises, and `async`/`await` later
* For now, follow these two rules when using `async` and `await`:

    1. `await` means "wait for the following thing to happen"
    2. when you use `await` inside a function, you must use `async` to define that function

> WARNING: `async` functions don't play nicely with `for` loops! (Fortunately, there are other ways to loop that do work well.)

# LAB: Full Name

* Now it's your turn to write a program from scratch.
* Write a program named `name.js` that asks two things:
  1. Your first name
  2. Your last name
* Then it says hello to the user by their *full name*.

* Run the program by typing `node name.js` on the command line.

# Lab: Name Length

* Change `name.js` so it also prints the number of characters in the user's name.
* For instance:

        What is your first name? Grace
        What is your last name? Hopper
        Hello, Grace Hopper!
        Your name is 11 characters long.

# Lab: Madlibs

Let's create a Madlib template! The goal for this lab is to create a program that will ask for certain types of words (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and once it has recieved a certain number of inputs it will insert those words, in the correct places, into a story which your computer will print to the terminal.

* create a story with at least five words omitted (it does not have to be a long story ~1 paragraph)
* create a function that asks for input for each of the omitted words
* print the story to the console, filling in the blanks with the provided words.
