# Browsers - what do they do?
* A web browser is a computer application that reads files. When entering a **domain** (ex. https://www.facebook.com) into the URL bar in a browser, the browser requests information in the form of a file associated with the URL input. 
* Your browser renders code in the form of a website. 

# Request - Response
* HTTP stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**. 
* In a nutshell, an HTTP request is sent by the **client** (a browser), which is used to locate information in the form of a file. * This file contains code, which tells your browser how, and what, to render. 
* A web server responds to this request, by telling the browser where the file lives.

# HTTP Methods
HTTP is a protocol that allows clients to communicate with web servers, and is a primary underlying infrastructure of the Internet. The two most common HTTP methods are:

* GET
* POST

When a URL is inputted, the browser sends a GET request to a web server. When a form is submitted on a website, a POST request is submitted, and the browser hands off the form data to be handled by the web server. 

# DNS - How it works!

* DNS stands for Domain Name System
* This is a standardized way for a browser to know **where** your website lives. 
* Your browser communicates with a **nameserver**, which tells your browser the IP address of where the files for your website are located. 
* Information on your nameservers are known as **DNS Records**.

Remember, websites live at an **IP Address**. This is a string of numbers, (ex. 70.42.251.42). A URL is simply a translation that provides humans with an easy way to remember where a website lives. It is important to remember however, not all websites can be accessed by their IP address. This can be due to security, or other reasons. 

# Other DNS Info
Your nameservers may also contain other information about your domain, such as where your email server lives. For example, if I try to send an email to mark@facebook.com, your email server is going to communicate with the nameserver for facebook.com and say, "Where does this email server live?". 

# Examples of Web Code
Web code can be any language used to create web pages or applications. Common examples of these are

* HTML and CSS
* Javascript
* PHP
* Ruby
* Python

For now, we are going to focus on **HTML and CSS**. This is the most common codebase used for creating webpages, and what is used for virtually all websites. 

# Browsers and Cross-Compatibility
It is important to note that not all browsers render HTML/CSS equally. We will explore this further later on in the course, however this is important to keep in mind as we move forward.
