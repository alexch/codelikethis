# Browser Tools

If you're running a program through your browser most modern browsers (i.e. Chrome, or FireFox) have built in debugging tools you can use!

# Step 1: Accessing the Dev Tools

In Chrome:

* `ctrl` + `shift` + `i` for a Windows machine

  * **or** right click and select `inspect` from the drop-down menu

* `cmd` + `option` + `i` for a Mac

  * **or** `option` + click and select `inspect` from the drop-down menu

In FireFox:

* `ctrl` + `shift` + `c` for a Windows machine

  * **or** right click and select `Inspect Element` from the drop-down menu

* `cmd` + `option` + `c` for a Mac

  * **or** `option` + click and select `Inspect Element` from the drop-down menu
 
# Step 2a: Add Breakpoints in Chrome

* In the dev tools, navigate to the `Sources` tab (to the immediate right of the `console` tab)

* Select the file you want to debug

* Click on the line number where you want to add your breakpoint

>Note: If you're unsure where your error is coming from you can add a break point at the top of your code and step through your whole program line by line

# Step 2b: Add Breakpoints in FireFox

* In the dev tools, navigate to the `Debugger` tab (to the immediate right of the `console` tab)

* Select the file you want to debug from the `Sources` section

* Click on the line number where you want to add your breakpoint

# Step 3: Run your Code

Once you've added a breakpoint run your code, and step through the section by clicking the `step over`  button or pressing `f10`.

If you've stepped through your code, and are still having issues finding where the errors are coming, or you find yourself traversing through previously unknown code there are several things you may want to try:

* Disable extensions

* Run in 'incognito' mode to make sure you're not caching bad code

* Try running the code in a different browser

* Try running it in a 'pristine' browser (a fresh install with no extensions or settings changes)

>Note: If your code runs on page load, you will need to refresh the page before the debugger takes effect.
