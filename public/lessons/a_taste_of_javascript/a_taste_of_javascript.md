# A Taste of JavaScript

You may never have coded before. Today you will.

# What will we learn?

In this class, you will learn about:

*  Code and coding
*  The command line and why we use it
*  How to run your code interactively or from a file
*  How to make a very simple website run on your own computer
*  How to deploy your website to the cloud, where anyone in the world can visit

Follow along online! Put a browser pointed at this site on one side of your screen, and Terminal on the other.

# What if I know some of this already?

* Pair up
* Help your partner, help your neighbor
* Docendo discimus ("By Teaching We Learn")
* Promote yourself to TA

> The best way to learn is to teach. <br>- [Latin proverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus)

# What is code?

Generally, *code* is something that stands for something else.

Specifically, *source code* is a series of instructions that tell a computer what to do.

> With computers, "code" is not about **secrets** -- it's about **symbols**.

# What is coding?

* coding is fun!
* coding is frustrating!
* coding is creative!
* coding is communication
  * between you and a computer
  * between you and other coders
  * between you and future you

# What is coding NOT?

* coding is **not** advanced mathematics
  * some logic (if / then / and / or / etc.)
  * mostly just counting ("do this 10 times")
* coding is **not** solitary
  * most coding happens in a team
  * all professional coding happens with clients / users / designers / managers etc.
  * pair programming is awesome
* coding is **not** about finding the right answer
  * there's always more than one way to do it
  * every solution has tradeoffs
  * there is always a better way, and never a perfect way
  * often the hardest part of coding is *defining* the problem, not solving it

> "The only perfect program is an empty file." - Alex

# A Program Is Like A Recipe

* a recipe is a collection of *ingredients* and *instructions*

![Grandma's Cookie Recipe](/images/cookie-recipe.gif)

* a program is a collection of *data* (ingredients) and *code* (instructions)

> When you are coding, you are not baking cookies; you are writing a recipe for how to make cookies.

Writing a recipe involves trying out the recipe (baking a test batch), then tweaking the recipe and trying again and again until you get it right.

# Languages

* every program is written in a **language**
  * like Java or Python or C or Fortran
  * even HTML and CSS and SQL are languages
  * computer languages all have very silly names
* computer languages are **very specific** compared to natural languages
* different languages are useful in different areas, but there is a lot of overlap
* today we will play with the JavaScript programming language

# Errors Are Awesome

* Don't be afraid of errors
* Your computer is trying to help you fix your program
  * It's just *really* bad at communicating

> If your code is a two-year-old child, then an error is a temper tantrum.

(It can take effort to figure out the underlying reason why they're upset and fix it.)

* It's not all gibberish
* Try to read it -- really try! -- and pull out the pearls from the pig slop

# JavaScript, child of the World Wide Web

* JavaScript was invented (in 1995) to allow "scripting" on web pages
* Prior to JavaScript, any input was sent to a *web server* via a *form*, and the user had to wait for a *new web page* to download before seeing any results or changes
* JavaScript allows a web page to respond immediately and interactively

For example:

```html
<button onclick='clicked()'>Click Me!</button>
<script>
let clicks = 0;
function clicked() {
  clicks = clicks + 1;
  event.target.textContent = clicks;
}
</script>
```

<button onclick='clicked()'>Click Me!</button>
<script>
let clicks = 0;
function clicked() {
  clicks = clicks + 1;
  event.target.textContent = clicks;
}
</script>

# The Command Line

* the **terminal** is a window into which you can talk directly to your computer
  * aka *console* or *command line* or *command prompt* or *shell*
* when you type into the terminal, you are issuing **commands** to the computer
* a *CLI* (Command Line Interface) is different from the *GUI* (Graphical User Interface) you are used to
  * a CLI is more primitive **and more powerful** than a GUI

# Historical Terminal

Computers used to not have screens! They were connected to devices like this:

![tty](/images/tty.jpg)

The Terminal app is a direct descendant of a TeleType printer or TTY.

When you type into the console and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> you are pretending to type a line onto a TTY; the scrolling terminal is like a roll of printer paper.

See [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/980825751456047104) for more history [and TTY pix](https://twitter.com/pdutta/status/980855463343476737).

# Lab: Opening the Terminal

* to open your Terminal:
  * **Mac OS**: launch the "Terminal" application
  * **Windows**: launch the "Cmder" application (pronounced "Commander"), make a new console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>T</kbd>) and select
    * Startup command: `{bash::bash}`
    * Startup directory: `C:\Users\yourname`
  * *Windows (alternate)*: Launch the Windows Command Prompt (`cmd.exe` or `PowerShell`) -- but beware, the commands are slightly different than in bash

* **Important:** make your terminal as **tall** as possible and *don't overlap windows*
  * when reading a program's output you want to start reading *at the top*...
  * ...and if your window is too short then the top lines will *scroll away* and you will miss them
  * Make it look like this:

![terminal next to browser](/images/terminal-and-browser.png)

# Lab: Interactive Calculator

1. open a terminal
1. look at the prompt -- it should end with a `$` or `>` symbol
1. type `node` -- that's you *commanding* the computer to launch *node*
1. press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key (also called <kbd>Enter</kbd>)
1. see the `>` prompt
1. type `1 + 1`
1. press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key again
1. see the `2`

* Yay! Your computer is an expensive calculator!
* **Bonus**: what other math can you do?

# Node is a JavaScript Engine

![Diagram: Node Train: Command Line](/images/train.png)

An "engine" is a type of program that either [*executes* or *empowers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engine) other programs.

NodeJS (aka `node`) is an engine that runs JavaScript programs -- either from files, or interactively from the command line.

# A Tale of Two Prompts

> WARNING: Before you start typing, look at the prompt!

* *the shell* is the lowest level command line
  * its prompt usually looks like this:
    *  `Davids-Macbook-Pro:~ David$` (Mac)
    *  `david@davidspc:~$` (Ubuntu Linux)
    *   `C:\Users\david>` (Windows)
* *node* is a command-line program that is launched *from the shell*
  * its prompt is usually just a greater-than `>` character

From inside `node`, if you want to get back to the shell...

  * type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> twice
  * or type `.exit` and <kbd>Enter</kbd>

# Basic Commands (Mac / Unix / Bash)

| Command | Purpose                 | Description                                             |
| :--     | :--                     | :--                                                     |
| `pwd`   | Print working directory | shows the name of the current directory                 |
| `cd`    | Change Directory        | move into a different directory                         |
| `ls`    | List sub                | shows the contents of the current directory             |
| `mkdir` | Make directory          | creates a new subdirectory inside the current directory |
| `touch` | Make a file             | creates an empty file with a name and file type         |
| `rm`    | Remove a file           | deletes a file from the file system                     |

> Windows shells have slightly different commands; if these commands don't work for you, ask a TA how to use "bash" instead.

# Home Directory

* the shell is always "inside" a directory
    * To find out which directory you are in, type `pwd`
    * This stands for "print working directory"
    * Most of the time the prompt also shows the current directory
* when you first open the Terminal you are in your **home directory**
* if you store files directly in your home directory, it will soon get cluttered
* for this class, we recommend:
  * create a `code` directory inside your home directory
  * create a new directory inside `code` for each project

# LAB: make a subdirectory and then enter it

1. Open **Terminal** or **Command Prompt**
1. Confirm that you are in your home directory
2. Make a new subdirectory using `mkdir code`
3. Change into that directory using `cd code`
4. Make sure you're really there using `pwd`
   * **On Windows** use `cd`
5. List its contents using `ls` (and note that it's empty)
   * **On Windows** use `dir`

# Source File

* source code is the essence of a program
* source files are text files that contain source code
* to **run** a JavaScript program you type `node` and then the name of the source file, like this:

```bash
$ node hello.js
Hello, World!
```

* The Recipe Metaphor
  * source file ≈ recipe
  * running a program ≈ cooking

# LAB: Hello, World

1. Make sure you are in your `code` subdirectory using `pwd` and/or `cd`
2. Open this directory in your text editor
3. Create a file named `hello.js` using the *File > New* menu
4. Inside this file, put the following source code:
    - `console.log("Hello, World!");`
5. Save the file
6. Switch back to the terminal (using <kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> or clicking)
  <br>(If you are using VS Code, you can click **Terminal &rarr; New Terminal** for the built-in terminal panel)
7. Run this file using:
    - `node hello.js`

What happens? Is this what you expected?

# LAB: Countdown

1. Inside your `code` directory, create a file named `countdown.js`
2. Inside this file, put the following source code:

```javascript
let count = 10;

while (count > 0) {
  console.log(count + '...');
  count = count - 1;
}

console.log('Blastoff!');
```

3. Save the file
4. In your terminal, run `node countdown.js`

# Analyzing Countdown

![Countdown Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vT5Z2Po-THntSfzUutbzDljBAxqCEE9gh7HTzRAalMMqpSol8BTqUnjsD6vexS-EFrO5FCNBKHqwbxQ/pub?w=960&amp;h=720)

# LAB: Changing Ingredients

* Remember the cooking analogy? The code is the instructions; now let's allow the user (you!) to change the ingredients
* Change line 1 to the following:

```javascript
let count = parseInt(process.argv[2])
```

* run the program with new inputs from the command line like this:

```shell
$ node countdown 5
$ node countdown 100
```

# ARGV

* `process` is a built-in *library object* provided by NodeJS
* `process.argv` is an *array* containing the *command-line arguments*
* For example, on my system, if I type `node countdown 99`, `argv` contains...

| index | meaning                         | value                                       |
|   :-- | :--                             | :--                                         |
|     0 | location of the NodeJS engine   | `'/usr/local/Cellar/node/11.10.0/bin/node'` |
|     1 | location of the current program | `'/Users/alex/code/countdown'`              |
|     2 | "first" command-line argument   | `'99'`                                      |

* Computers (usually) start counting at zero, so `process.argv[2]` gets the third item from the array `process.argv`
