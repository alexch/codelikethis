# What is a computer?

* A calculating machine
  * desktop
  * laptop
  * cell phone
  * smart phone

# The Universal Machine

* A computer can do anything
  * (at least on the inside)
* This can be intimidating!
* But the basic rules are simple

# The Terminal

* the *TERMINAL* is a window into which you can talk directly to your computer

# In The Beginning Was The Command Line

* the *TERMINAL* is a window into which you can talk directly to your computer
* aka *console* or *command line* or *command prompt* or *shell* or *prompt*
  * contrast *CLI* (Command Line Interface) to *GUI* (Graphical User Interface)

* ["In The Beginning Was The Command Line"](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html) is an essay by Neil Stephenson describing the history of computers in an enjoyable and clever way

# {Ruby} irb - the Interactive Ruby Browser

## Exercise: Calculator

* open a terminal
* type `irb`
* press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key (also called <kbd>Enter</kbd>)
* see the `>` prompt
* type `1 + 1`
* press the `return` key again
* see the `2`
* yay, a $1000 calculator!

* Bonus: what other math can you do?

* From now on, whenever you see text in the `code font`, try typing it into irb and see what happens!

# node - the Interactive JavaScript Executor

## Exercise: Calculator

* open a terminal
* type `node`
* press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key (also called <kbd>Enter</kbd>)
* see the `>` prompt
* type `1 + 1`
* press the `return` key again
* see the `2`
* yay, a $1000 calculator!

* Bonus: what other math can you do?

* From now on, whenever you see text in the `code font`, try typing it into irb and see what happens!

The basic architecture of computers has not changed since the invention of the 
[Von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)
in the 1940s.

# Computer Anatomy: Software

* Operating System
* Libraries
* Drivers
* Applications
* Languages

Every piece of software on your computer is a PROGRAM.

# A Program Is Like A Recipe

* a recipe is a collection of *ingredients* and *instructions*

![Grandma's Cookie Recipe](/images/cookie-recipe.gif)

* a program is a collection of *data* and *code*

> When you are writing code, you are not baking cookies, you are writing a recipe for how to make cookies.

* coding is more like America's Test Kitchen than like Top Chef -- you may run many test batches, but the goal is not cookies, but a recipe so someone else can make cookies later 

(recipe from popcornpottery.com)

# Languages

* every program is written in a LANGUAGE
  * like Java or Python or C or Fortran
  * even HTML and CSS and SQL are languages
  * every computer language has a silly name
* different languages are useful in different areas, but there is a lot of overlap
* today we will learn the **RUBY** programming language

# Errors Are Awesome

* Don't be afraid of errors
* Your computer is trying to help you fix your program
  * It's just *really* bad at communicating
  
> If your code is a two-year-old child, then an error is a temper tantrum. 

* It's not all gibberish
* Try to read it -- really try! -- and pull out the pearls from the pig slop
