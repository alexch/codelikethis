# Project Planning, pre-Agile

* Waterfall 
  * NASA-style
* Auteurism 
  * "It's done when it's done"
* Death March
  * Fixed scope, fixed time, fixed cost => 
  * low quality of code
  * low quality of life
* the Mythical Man-Month 
  * adding more people to a late project makes it more late

# The Agile Manifesto

# Manifesto Principles

# Extreme Programming (XP)

Instead of saying "we should really do X..."

what if we do X **all the time** ?

(where X is testing, code review, incremental design, refactoring, ...)

# XP values

* Communication
* Feedback
* Simplicity
* Courage

# iterations 

* Time box
* work, measure, plan, repeat

# yesterday's weather

The most efficient way to answer the question,

> "What will today's weather be?"

is with the question,

> "What was the weather yesterday?"

...sure it'll be wrong 20% of the time, but that's a **much** better rate than every other planning system 

# continuous improvement

First learn the rules

then obey the rules

then improve the rules

(then repeat)

# retrospectives

see [cadence](./cadence) and [retrospectives](./retrospectives) lessons
