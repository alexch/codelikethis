# Retrospectives 

At regular intervals, the team meets to discuss

   * What's working well
   * What's working poorly
   * What processes should we try next?
   * Appreciations for teammates
   * Any last thoughts?

# Retrospectives are...

* facilitated by a coach or other team member
  * **not** by a manager or tech lead
* driven by the attendees in the moment
  * **not** by an agenda agreed upon beforehand
* focused on the *process* in general, or on a specific *crisis* or *problem* that happened recently
  * **not** a status meeting 
  * **not** for management to make announcements or impose a new rule
  * **not** to discuss features or planning (though it might spawn other meetings about these items)

# Retrospective Attitude

* keep an open mind
* be respectful
* listen more than you speak

# The Bible
