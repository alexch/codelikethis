# Pair Programming

Pair programming = 

Two people +

One problem

(and usually, one computer, one keyboard, one screen...

...notwithstanding remote pairing tools and face-to-face pairing desks)

# Pair Programming Benefits

> Two heads are better than one!

* avoid dead ends and ratholes
* simultaneously focus on current problem *and* context (one focus per person)
* "rubber duck" - explaining a problem out loud often leads directly to a solution
* instant code review
* exploit complementary expertise / memory / personality / energy levels
* less likely to fall into bad habits or get stuck

# Pair Programming finds the Maximum of Two Minds

[show graph of maxima]

Every person thinks a little differently, has different expertise / experience / energy / perspective.

So for any given problem, at any given moment, one of the partners will be more able to solve that problem.

With pair programming, you get the *best of two* at every moment.

(And often you get solutions that are better than any individual would have come up with alone.)

# Pairing is efficient

MYTH: pairing reduces productivity by 50%

FACT: pairing (when done well) *increases* productivity, especially when the problem requires creativity to solve

(pairing also increases communication, satisfaction, and the rate of high-fives per minute)

# Pairing is teaching

_Docendo discimus_ - "by teaching we learn"
 
* Expert-expert pairing -- best case; experts share tidbits and experience as peers
* Novice-novice pairing -- good case; novices can struggle and discover together 
* Expert-novice pairing -- **beware** -- in this case, the expert must accept the role of mentor or teacher, and be patient and let the novice drive most of the time

# Roles

* Driver
* Navigator

# Driver

* writes code, runs tests, has control of code
* focuses on one problem at a time
* self-narrates at a high level
  * e.g. "Okay, now let's introduce a random number function"
  * NOT "I'm now creating a variable named X that I'm assigning the value 4"
    * assume your navigator can read the code and understand it; the goal is to communicate *purpose* and *intention*, not mechanics

# Navigator

* keeps a "todo" list
* politely reminds driver, e.g.
  * can we write a test for that?
  * can we refactor a bit now?
  * let's check in
  * let's revert
  * let's take a break
* *always asks permission* before grabbing the keyboard
  * "do you mind if I drive now?"
* silently **count to 10** before interrupting with e.g. a typo or syntax error
  * chances are that the driver will notice and fix it themselves 

# Tag Team

> Switch roles often!

* at least once per hour, preferably more frequently
* [pomodoro technique](http://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/projects/pomodoro) can help -- code for 25 min, then take a 5 min break, then switch drivers

# Ping Pong

* Alice and Bob are pairing

1. Alice writes a unit test and gets it to fail correctly
2. Alice hands the keyboard to Bob
3. Bob writes code until the unit test passes ("goes green")
4. Bob writes a unit test and gets it to fail correctly
5. Bob hands the keyboard to Alice
6. Alice writes code until the unit test passes ("goes green")
7. Repeat until done!

# Breath Mints

> It's better to have them and not need them, than to need them and not have them.

# Do...

* Talk. A lot.
* Ask questions.
* Listen.
* Say something if you don't understand or disagree. 
* Be patient.
* Swap roles *often*. 
    * at least every 30 minutes
* Take breaks *regularly*.
    * at least once an hour
* High five!
* Enjoy it!

# Don't...

* get too frustrated
* be a keyboard hog
* be a backseat driver (instead, ask to take the wheel!)
* be bossy
* be intimidated by partner's knowledge
* be shy
* be silent 
  * about your ideas / questions
  * about your partner being rude
