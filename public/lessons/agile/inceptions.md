# What is an Inception?

* an exploratory workshop…
* where the whole team…
* defines the goals and themes for a project…
* and produces an initial backlog…
* to kickstart an iterative process

# Before the Inception

Some research and development has happened, e.g.

  * Business / Market / User Research
  * some user experience design
  * some user testing of mockups

No code has been written

  * (or, any code that has been written will be thrown away)

Resources and time have been allocated for a short project 

  * (inception + discovery + maybe one MVP)

# Inception Goals

* define the project’s goals, anti-goals, risks
* produce an initial story backlog
* produce a rough project timeline
* establish initial recurring schedule for team meetings
* sketch technical architecture (but avoid Big Design Up Front)
* introduce the team to each other
* define who is the customer (and other responsibilities)

# Optional Inception Goals

* write elevator pitch and/or mission statement
* define user Personas, Roles and Activities
* build paper prototype or wireframe sketches
* write team charter
* determine need for more discovery
* start project glossary (aka *ubiquitous language* or *domain language*)
* examine assumptions (scope, schedule, feasability, business goals, risks, user population, team size, etc.)

# Inception Anti-Goals

* working software
  * an inception is **not** a hackathon
* set anything in stone
  * it's an iterative process; everything may change
* set rigid requirements and deadlines
  * we will know more later
* others?

# Inception Schedule

* can be one day, two days, or a full week
* needs a facilitator
* invite as much of the whole team as possible

# Project Goals

*  keep all goals SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant & time-bound)

*  business goals
*  product goals
*  engagement goals

# Team goals

* workday experience and pacing
* exploring technology vs. exercising skills
* using new or old processes (e.g. remote pairing)

# Project Non-Goals

* aka "The Not List"
*  things we explicitly do not want to accomplish in the project
*  useful when there’s a priority decision to be made
  *  e.g. if a non-goal is "support mobile" then we can ignore Mobile Safari UI bugs
* It's also OK to list unknown or unresolved goals

# Project Risks

* Business risks
  * Does the market want this?  
  * Will an emerging technology disrupt this product? 
  * Can the client support success?
* Technical risks
  * Are there 3rd party integrations?
  * Are there unknown technologies or libraries to learn?
  * Does the product rely on platforms that are changing, e.g. Android or Apple Watch?
* Schedule risks
  * Is there a near term, immovable milestone like a festival or holiday?
  * Are there bottlenecks or signoffs, e.g. developers on another team?  
* Budget risks
  * Will we run out of money (aka "runway") before beta? Before launch? Before handoff?
* Other risks?
  * Legal or regulatory?
  * Safety?
  * Specialized knowledge (e.g. human language fluency)?

# Team Risks

How do we want to work?

* Part-time (vs. dedicated) team?
* Remote (vs. co-located) team?
* Customer availability? (in-room, on-site, etc.)
* Deployment environment? (stability, automation, scripting, other hassles)
* Desired test coverage?
* Desired role ratios? 
    * Customer :: Project Manager :: Developer :: Designer :: QA Tester :: Support :: Ops :: Coach

# Elevator Pitch

Play the ![Mad Libs](/images/mad-libs.jpg) Pitch Game!

> An elevator pitch is a concise, clear, persuasive explanation of a product that can be told in the time it would take to ride an elevator.

Split into small groups and within each group, brainstorm to fill in the following template:

For ______ who need ______, the ______ is a ______ that ______.
Unlike ______, our product ______.

Then select a spokesperson to share your result with the group. If time allows, collaborate to create a consensus pitch statement.

# Elevator Pitch Example

(from <https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/>)

# Mission Statement Game

* everyone writes a draft mission statement
* pass them around the group and highlight important/recurring words
* write those words on a whiteboard
    * then dot-vote on them, and use **at most** the top three or four
* collaborate to write and reach consensus on a final mission statement
  * hopefully without a lot of run-on "and" clauses
  * example (bad): _"focusing on birds, other wildlife, and their habitats"_

> Consensus is hard; concise consensus is a miracle.

# Personas

![example persona](https://blog.alexa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Buyer-Persona-Examples-B2C-Retail.jpg)

## Sections:
 * picture
 * motto (quote)
 * demographics
 * bio / personality
 * goals
 * frustrations

# Persona Details

*  persona design comes from user research, so traditionally, personas represent types of *end users*
*  but practically, don't limit yourself to end users -- you can and should make personas for any human in the system
    *  developers, clients, admins, customer support reps, QA testers, apps, spammers…
*  only one persona per sheet
* pick a real-sounding name (not a cute pun) and invent details that have nothing to do with your product
  * this facade will help activate the creative, narrative, storytelling part of your brain
  * often you will discover new use cases or scenarios *via* these ostensibly irrelevant details
* there are many online persona tutorials and even *persona generators*:

# Persona Sections

After creating the personas, you can start applying them to the system you're designing, e.g...

## Marketing Plan

* for each persona, list ways to reach them

## Roles and Activities

* for each persona, ask what they can do (and can’t)
* start to diagram relationships among personae and activities and roles
* start to make timelines and sequence diagrams showing communication and workflow between roles and documents

# Story Mapping

*  very time-consuming
*  take plenty of breaks! facilitator, don’t rush!
*  the goal is to get broad and deep, clustering rather than prioritizing
*  looking for themes, not details
*  but still, try to break down stories into smaller stories

> ["The goal isn’t to get all the cards created, but to establish a rhythm of story creation."](http://agilecoffee.com/using-an-inception-to-kick-off-a-project/)

# Story Mapping Example

![Winninpeg Example Story Map](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KWX3M3EbdzY/VTZr6PNJ1rI/AAAAAAAAAOs/8HTZDtGw1zc/s1600/UserStoryMap.png)

<http://winnipegagilist.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-to-create-user-story-map.html>

# Stories

* A story:
  * provides business value
  * is discrete
  * is testable
  * is estimatable
  * can be implemented within 1 iteration
* Usually one story per feature, bug, or chore

(For more see the [Planning](planning#stories) lesson.)

# Story Body Template

Story *titles* should be brief and imperative; story *bodies* should follow this pattern:

```
AS A ____      [role or persona]
I WANT TO ____ [action or goal]
SO THAT ___    [value or motivation]
```

e.g. 

|Sort By Price|
|---|
|As a customer, I want to sort the matching cars by price, so that I can see the best deal.|

# Acceptance Criteria Template

Generally a single *story* has several *acceptance criteria*, which are often written following this pattern:

```
GIVEN ____    [precondition or scenario]
WHEN ____     [the user does something, or something interesting happens]
THEN ____     [the system is in this state, or responds in this way]
```

* The "then" part must be something observable, ideally by an automated test.
* Use present tense for WHEN and subjunctive mood ("should") for THEN
* During the Inception, don't worry too much about filling in acceptance criteria for all stories, but it can be useful to do so for important or mysterious stories.

## Example:

<!--BOX-->

**GIVEN** I have $100 in my bank account, <br>
**WHEN** I attempt to withdraw $200, <br>
**THEN** the bank should reject the transaction <br>
**AND** I should still have $100 in my account

<!--/BOX-->

# Epics

* An Epic is a series of Stories
  * Can also be called a *Theme* or a *Feature Set*
* For instance, the epic “User Accounts” could include “Sign up, Sign in, Change password, Edit profile, Upload pic”
* Put epics across the top row of your story map
  * Put stories in columns underneath their epic

# Story Mapping Order

1. Write Story Titles
2. Organize Stories into Epics
3. Prioritize Stories under Epics
4. Write Stories
5. Estimate Stories
6. Prioritize Stories into a Backlog (across Epics)

# Advice for Facilitators

(for Story Mapping or any planning or retrospective workshop)

*  Stay impartial
*  Assign a Timekeeper and a Scribe (so you can focus on the meeting, not the logistics)
*  Try to ask questions, not make statements
*  After asking a question, count to ten! someone else will fill the silence
*  Ask clarifying questions, even if you know the answer
*  If the conversation veers, steer it back to the original topic (or ask for consensus to change topics)
  * Use a Parking Lot (or IOU) list for items to deal with immediately after the meeting
*  If the conversation ebbs, ask if anyone sees a pattern… or has a suggestion… or if it’s time for a break

# Iteration Zero

* sometimes inceptions reveal that a project is not yet ready to build
* the first iteration can be used for continuing the discovery phase of a project
* the team can use the first iteration (sprint) for...
  * building a prototype
  * "spiking" proof of concept on architectural or usability unknowns
  * setting up technical infrastructure (build, deployment, environments)
* these experiments should be bounded and scoped just like "real" features

# Recurring Meetings

Inceptions are a great place to establish the regular rhythm of the project, as punctuated by recurring meetings.

*  Standup (daily)
*  [Planning Meeting](planning) (at least once per iteration, up to several a week)
*  [Acceptance](planning) (can be weekly, semi-weekly, ad hoc, or any combination)
*  Demo (often coincides with Acceptance, but not always)
*  [Retrospective](planning) (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)
*  User Testing sessions
* Others?

# Next Steps

* Review Parking Lot / IOUs
* Schedule additional meetings
* Assign someone to capture cards and diagrams into Tracker

# Retrospective & Closing

* Have a brief (5 min.) retrospective about this inception.
  * What worked?
  * What didn't?
  * Specific feedback for the facilitator?
* Appreciation Circle
* Any last thoughts?

# Party Time!

* We're done!
