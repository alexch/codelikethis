# Lightning Talk

Prepare a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) on a coding-related topic. Sign up for a slot and present it to the class.

Optional: present it to the JS meetup during one of their Lightning Talk sessions.

## Rules:

* talk: 8 min max
* Q&A: 5 min max
* slop: 2 min max
* 15 min * 10 per day = ~ 2.5 hrs + 30 min break = 9:00 - 10:15, 10:45-12:00
* ignite rules? (autoadvance after exactly 20 sec per slide, 24 slides exactly) -- technically hard and possibly too stressful, should discuss with students
