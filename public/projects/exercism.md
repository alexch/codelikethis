# Local Exercism Clone

Exercism.io is a web site and command-line tool for learning to program. It is a great way to get help from people far away.

For this course, we have made a *custom fork* of Exercism and modified it to work locally.

1. Visit <https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/exercism-javascript> and click the green "Clone or Download" button
2. Copy that Git URL; it should be something like `git@github.com:BurlingtonCodeAcademy/exercism-javascript.git`
3. Open your local Terminal program and visit your `code` directory
4. Clone the repo by running `git clone git@github.com:BurlingtonCodeAcademy/exercism-javascript.git` (or "git clone" and paste)
5. `cd exercism-javascript`
6. Install Jasmine with `npm install -g jasmine`
7. Run a local server with `node .`
8. Visit <http://localhost:5000> for more instructions!
9. Do as many exercises (in order!) as you can
