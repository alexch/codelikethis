# Capstone Project

During the last four weeks of this course, you'll spend most of your afternoons working on a single project. 

Because the goal of this course is to prepare you for work on a software development team, your capstone project must be developed in a team. Team size can be as small as 2 people or as large as 6 (or 8, maybe, with special permission). Since we love to pair program, it's best if your team has an even number of members, but an odd number can also work (please discuss this with staff first).

# Step 1: Discovery

Spend this time exploring ideas and building a team. 

Do you have an idea? Discuss it with your fellow students.

Do you want to work with a client (or "project sponsor")? Here are some local projects that could use your help:

* http://www.codeforbtv.org/projects/cvoeo-app - build a mobile app for a non-profit to help several hundred Vermonters per year to manage their money, complete their paperwork, and earn up to $750/year from Financial Futures benefits

* http://codeforbtv.org/projects/greenup-app - work on the official Green Up Day mobile app (written in React Native), or grab a side project like facilitating communication between team leaders or displaying an embedded map in their web site

* https://www.codeforamerica.org/past-projects/court-bot - integrate (or reimplement) CourtBot with the Vermont docket; CourtBot sends text messages or makes voice calls (using Twilio) to prompt people about outstanding citations or court appearances


# Step 2: Proposal

[TODO: deadline for this step?]

Write up a brief (500 words or less) project proposal. Include

  * the team members
  * the business or personal issue the project will solve
  * a rough description of core features

Schedule a time to discuss the project with a teacher. We will evaluate it for feasibility, or send it back for more work (or for replacement with a different idea).

If it's acceptable, we'll assign you a coach, who will check in with your team as needed, and attend demos, retros and planning meetings for advice and counsel.

If your project is sponsorless (i.e. your own idea), your coach (or maybe another student?) may agree to act as the sponsor, or help you find one. (In XP/Agile this role is called the "customer" or "business owner"; it's useful to have a person who's detached from the day-to-day coding to make decisions about priority and scope.)

# Step 3: Inception

Schedule a time during the first week in August for a project inception. Invite all team members and stakeholders (the project sponsor if you have one)and your coach. Allow at least 4 hours, intending to come out of the meeting with some rough wireframes, a story grid, a system architecture, and a work plan for each of four weeks. If you need to do more planning, schedule another 2-hour planning meeting for later in the week.

# Step 4: Iteration

During each of the four weeks, schedule the following:

 * Weekly planning meeting
 * Daily standup meeting
 * Weekly retrospective
 * Acceptance meeting / sponsor demo (weekly, or more frequently if possible) -- to get the client to sign off on the features, report bugs, and adjust priorities
 * In-class demo (show and tell!) -- we will set up Friday morning slots during weeks 2 and 3 for you to demo your app to the class; consider this a dress rehearsal for Hiring Partner Demo Day
