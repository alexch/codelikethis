# Portfolio Page

## Background

A "Personal Portfolio" is a web site that showcases your personal work. It can serve as a resume that people can interact with to see examples of the work in question.

We will use [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) to build and host your portfolio site.

## Portfolio Sitemap.xml

* Create a [sitemap.txt file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) for Search Engines to use.
* **Automatic generation**: Use the [Node Sitemap Generatore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sitemap-generator-cli) to build an XML file which contains all your pages files.
  * `npx sitemap-generator-cli yourusername.github.io`
* **Manual generation**: Use the  http://www.advancedhtml.co.uk/robots-sitemaps.htm#sitemaps for instructions
* OPTIONAL: submit your site to Google https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en and (in a day or two) wait to see your sitemap reflected in the Google search results
  * (the easiest way to verify it is "Alternative Methods - HTML tag")
