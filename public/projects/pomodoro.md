# Pomodoro

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a [useful way](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) to [focus on a problem](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) for [a little while... but not too long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) that encourages regular breaks and can [change your perception of time itself](https://hackernoon.com/change-how-you-perceive-time-618282a1a9ec). 

Build a single-page app that counts down from 25 minutes and makes audible and visual alerts when the time elapses.

Clone the your repository created by the GitHub classroom link. The tests use the [Cypress Mock Clock](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks.html#Clock) to control time during test runs.

## Wireframes

```

After implementing the basic features, feel free to implement your own ideas of layout and style using CSS.

## Considerations

* the buttons should be *enabled* and *disabled* based on the system's state; e.g. if the timer is not running, the Pause button should be disabled
* JavaScript timing events are not guaranteed to be precise. That means that even if you ask for a callback once a second, you might actually get a callback after 1.1 seconds... or even later if your app is running in the background, or if there are [other sources of lag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout#Late_timeouts). That means that you cannot simply decrement a "seconds" variable once per callback if you want accurate wall-clock time synchronization.
* seconds should be 0-padded e.g. `1:03` not `1:3`

## Tech

* JavaScript [timing events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp) like [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) and [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout)
* HTML5 [Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement)
* [Date.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) function

# Stories

> Please implement these user stories in order. There are Cypress acceptance tests for most of them in the repo. Feel free to add your own unit tests and/or acceptance tests too!

<!--BOX-->

## Countdown

**Given** a set duration of 25 minutes

**When** the user clicks the Start button

**Then** the timer should begin counting down once per second, following the sequence: `24:59`, `24:58`, `24:57`, ... `24:00`, `23:59`, ... and so on

**And** the Start button should be *disabled*

<!--/BOX-->
<!--BOX-->

## Zero!

**Given** that the timer is counting down 

**When** it reaches `0:00`

**Then** the timer should stop counting down

**And** the Start button should be *disabled*

**And** the Pause button should be *disabled*

<!--/BOX-->
<!--BOX-->

## Reset

**When** the user clicks Reset

**Then** the timer should reset to 25 min 00 sec

**And** the countdown should stop (if was in progress)

**And** the Start button should be *enabled*

<!--/BOX-->
<!--BOX-->

## Ding!

**Given** that the timer is counting down 

**When** it reaches `0:00`

**Then** it should [play a sound](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18628124/190135)

<!--/BOX-->
<!--BOX-->

## Pause

**Given** that the timer is counting down 

**When** the user clicks the Pause button

**Then** the countdown should stop

**And** the Pause button should be *disabled*

**And** the Start button should be *enabled*

<!--/BOX-->

<!--BOX-->
## Resume

**Given** the game is paused

**When** the user clicks the Start button

**Then** the timer should resume from the current time.

<!--/BOX-->

<!--BOX-->

## Flash!

**Given** that the timer is counting down 

**When** it reaches `0:00`

**Then** it should visibly flash the screen (be creative)

**And** the timer should stop counting down

**When** the user clicks Reset

**Then** the flashing should stop

<!--/BOX-->

## Icebox

> optional features; implement these -- or think of your own! -- when you're done with the backlog.

* change duration to 2 different set values (10 min and 2 min)
* change duration to arbitrary value (user input)
* display the remaining time in the title of the tab (or browser window) so users can check it at a glance
* look at <https://tomato-timer.com/> for inspiration
* use [Notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API)
* keyboard shortcuts
