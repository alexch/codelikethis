### Apple Xcode Command-Line Tools

You will be using the default Terminal.app program to access command-line tools and execute programs throughout the course. If you have never opened the Terminal.app program before, visit [this documentation page from Apple to learn how to do so.](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/2.11/mac/11.0)

Some of the command-line tools which used to be installed by default on MacOS are not installed optionally by using the `xcode-select --install` command within the Terminal.app.

Follow the instructions below to install the tools required to be able to use additional developer tools, including MacOS Homebrew.

1. Open the MacOS **Terminal** and type

        xcode-select --install

2. In the dialog box, click the **Install** button
4. You may be asked to enter your user login password
3. Wait several minutes for the download and installation to complete

### MacOS Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS that lets you install tools directly from the Terminal. Once it's installed, it's generally easier to use Homebrew than to use a web browser and graphical installer app.

These instructions are for recent versions of MacOS (MacOS v10.14 Mojave or newer). If these do not work for you, don't worry we can assist you in installing the tools another way.

#### Install Homebrew

1. Visit https://brew.sh
2. Find the section labeled "Install Homebrew"
3. Copy the **entire line** beneath "Install Homebrew"
4. Open a **Terminal.app** window and paste the copied text
5. The text will look like this, please refer to the text from the <https://brew.sh> homepage

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

4. Enter your password and hit <kbd>Return</kbd> as prompted, **you will not see the characters as you type your password**, this is default behavior in command-line applcations.

### Node.js (JavaScript)

We prefer to use the `brew` command to install Node.js. If you have not yet installed Homebrew in the instructions above, please do so.

#### Install Node.js using Homebrew

1. Open a Terminal.app window and type the following, followed by <kbd>Return</kbd>

        brew install node

2. Confirm that Node.js is installed by typing the command below, followed by <kbd>Return</kbd>

        node --version

3. You should see a version string such as v16.1.0 or similar

        v16.1.0

#### Alternative Install of Node.js

If you cannot install Homebrew or have a problem installing Node.js using Homebrew, you can instead use the Node.js foundation installation steps.


1. Visit the Node.js homepage at <https://nodejs.org/en/>
2. Version v16.1.x **Current** is preferred (the button on the right side)
3. Check that a version of Node.js is installed
4. Open a Terminal.app window and type the command below followed by <kbd>Return</kbd>

        node --version

5. You should see a version string such as v16.1.0 or similar

        v16.1.0

### Git Version Control System

#### Git Command Line Tool

The version control tool Git is installed when you completed the command `xcode-select --install`. If for some reason you were unable to install the Xcode command-line tools, then you can install Git manually by following the instructions below.

1. Visit the Git Downloads page at  <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
2. Download the installer for MacOS
3. Run the installer from the Downloads folder, you may be asked for your password
4. Confirm that Git is installed by running the command below followed by <kbd>Return</kbd>

          git --version
