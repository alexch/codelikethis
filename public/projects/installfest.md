## VS Code Text Editor

  * **Install** VS Code from Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com>

## Node.js (JavaScript)

  * **Install** Node.js from <https://nodejs.org/>
  * version 12.X.X Current is preferred (the button on the right side)
    * run `node -v` in terminal to check
    * if you can't install v12, anything past 10.X.X LTS is probably okay

# MacOS Only

## Mac Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS that lets you install tools directly from the Terminal. Once it's installed, it's generally easier to use Homebrew than to use a web browser and graphical installer app.

These instructions are for recent versions of MacOS. If these do not work for you, don't worry; cancel out and follow the instructions above instead.

## XCode Command-Line Tools

1. Open **Terminal** and type

        xcode-select --install
2. On the dialog box, click the **Install** button
3. Wait several minutes for the download to complete

## Homebrew

1. Visit https://brew.sh
2. Copy the *entire line* underneath "Install Homebrew"
3. Open **Terminal** and paste
4. Enter your password and hit <kbd>Return</kbd> as prompted

## NodeJS and Git

Open Terminal and type the following:

```
brew install node
brew install git
```

If all goes well, sign up for GitHub and Heroku using the instructions above.
