## Tech

### Voice & Video Sharing

Some or all of the video conference tools below to share your webcam and microphone with your pair.
These tools also have the ability to share your screen, see the instructions below for that.

* [Zoom Video Conference](https://zoom.us "Zoom Video Conference")
* [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/ "Google Hangouts")
* [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/ "Skype Video Conference")

### Screen Sharing

#### VS Code Extension (Optional)

VS Code Live Share is an extension in beta where two programmers can share their editor windows in real time.
You will need to sign up for the service as an "early access user" since it is in limited preview.

* [VS Code Live Share - Announcement](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share "VS Code Live Share Announcement")
* [VS Code Live Share - Sign Up](https://code.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-live-share "Visual Studio Code Live Share Sign UP")

There is a third-party extension for VS Code which facilitates syncronizing two remote editors.
This extension may be buggy due to it being fairly new.
Your mileage may vary.

* [SocksCode-VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shyykoserhiy.sockscode-vscode "SocksCode-VSCode")

#### Atom Teletype Extension (Optional)

If you really feel like you want a built in editor sharing solution and your pair already uses the Atom editor, you can install Atom and the extension to provide real time collaboration here.
