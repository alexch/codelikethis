# GitHub Emoji

GitHub supports emoji inside commit messages and pull request comments.

Their list of emoji is long (currently 1500+) and they sometimes add emoji to this list, so instead of using a static web page to list them, they added an endpoint to their API that lists them all in a giant hash.

Check it out here: <https://api.github.com/emojis>

## One Big List

**Given** the user visits the homepage of your app

**When** the page is loaded,

**Then** the app should fetch the list of emoji from GitHub,

**And** the user should see all emoji in a long list

## Filter By Name

**When** the user enters a word into the "Filter" text field

**Then** the list should show only those emoji whose names contain that word

**Other Considerations**: if the list is immediately updated after every keypress, then it might cause performance problems or visual stutter. One way to limit this is to use a *cooldown timer* so that the filtering action only happens a second or so *after* the user presses a key, to allow for many keypresses in a row without interruption.
