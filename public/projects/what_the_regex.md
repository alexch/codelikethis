# What the /^\re*[ge]+x?$/

In this project you will learn about regular expressions.

A Regular Expression is a program that matches (or fails to match) parts of a string. Regular Expressions are often found inside of other, larger programs, but in this section we'll be learning them independently. As a programming language, regexes are very concise and can be difficult to understand; try to think of it as a cipher or puzzle and have fun learning its arcane rules without worrying too much about what they're used for.

## Simple language matching library

This library is similar to Regular Expressions but uses more verbose word-like symbols. It's is not the same as a RegExp but can help to form the problem if you think in a more narrative way.
