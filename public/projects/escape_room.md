# Escape Room

## Goals:

* Get to know your cohort
* Think logically *and* creatively *at the same time*
* Learn to read instructions *carefully* and follow them *in sequence* 
* Get used to having your assumptions challenged or reversed
* Communicate clearly and civilly in a stressful and new environment
* Recognize when you are frustrated, but still persist and keep trying 
  * (and/or take a breath and/or take a break and/or get a snack)
* Take a large, complex problem and break it down into smaller, more readily solvable problems ("divide and conquer")
